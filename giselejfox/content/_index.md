Welcome to my website! 

Right now this serves as a blog to document my experience with the iSchool-Honors Netherlands Study Abroad program. It's a 4 week long program that examines how innovation works in library, information, and museum services, practices, and designs in the Netherlands and Belgium. 

I'll be posting at least 3 times a week journaling, analyzing, and reflecting on the site visits and the lectures I attend. Needless to say I'm incredibly excited!
