Welcome in! Eventually this will turn into a personal website but for now it will serve a blog I'll keep up during my 2022 summer study abroad 4-week program.

The study abroad is based in Amsterdam, led by Professor Trent Hill, and examines innovations in library and museum practice, services, and design in the Netherlands and Belgium.

I'll be posting at least 3 times a week journaling, reflecting, and analyzing what we're learning as we're out and about in the Netherlands for 4 weeks!
