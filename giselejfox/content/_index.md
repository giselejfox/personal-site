Welcome to my website! A host of all that I find interesting. 

In the **Projects** page you'll find all my favorite projects I've done as of late all the way from self-made knitting patterns to podcasts and coding projects.

If you want to learn more about me check out my **Things I Like** page for a master list of, you guessed it, things I like. 

You can also head to the **About** page to read a more classic introduction along with a lil' life story.
