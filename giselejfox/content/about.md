## Hey there

My name is Gisele, I'm currently a rising senior at the University of Washington graduating with a degree in informatics.

I grew up in Seattle but my family moved to Italy when I was 8. We spent 4 1/2 years there as me and my younger brother settled into the local Italian schools and soccer teams
