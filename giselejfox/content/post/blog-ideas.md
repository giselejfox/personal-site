## Academic or Amsterdam based (not super me focused but my own input)

### Barriers to Co-creation in college
- start off by saying what is co creation
- why it's hard to cocreate in college projects
- why that feels off

### Relocation of the royal library and what that'll look like

### Innovation is about reframing what problems are
- simple example the book ferry
    - there was a fair amount of time on the ferry that was spent unused and just for commute. This gal saw the opportunity to get people together and use that time for community building and book reading.
- we talked about latchey kids and how they are a problem to libraries. Well let's take a different look, it's not a problem it's a community need. How can we innovate to meet that community need.
- Similar thoughts can go into immigration, is it a problem or a resource. Why isn't it better to have more people in a place where they can thrive. 
- Even the "slower" healthcare system here, they made a system that can meet the needs of everybody and it does slow it down but everyone can be helped in some capacity. It still works and people are still healthy.
- Life could be so much better if we take a look at problems and see them for what they actually are: community needs.
    - latchkey kids -> create a space for kids to come in the specific hours after school

### Analyzing and contrasting amsterdam and Seattle's public facing information of public policy and urban planning. Then go in and see how they're actually moving forward on those innitiatives
- why their approaches are different
    - amsterdam has a constrained city limit, seattle doesn't(?)

## Kind of me focused and my relation to the material/amsterdam

### Ode to working in a physical space

me just complaining about informatics

### My experiences with the 10 faces of innovation

## Misc

### Why I like these types of lectures
- discussion based
- short in the day
- feels like a genuine conversation and everybody's interested

### Gisele's efforts in community building
- explanation that I was scared to go on the trip
- explaining how I usually interact (questions)
- giving some examples of what I did
    - passing the note around the table - face sketch
    - asking people about the barter list
    - xtra good questions to ask
- what I've seen other people do that I like
    - if I'm spaced out just wave at me
    - ask me how I'm holding up
    - include everybody in everything (sandy's discord is a savng grace)
    - ask a good funny question
        - if you would be a furniture what would you be? - it's nice to see how someone imagines themselves as being maybe useful or somewhere comfortable for someone to return to... very interesting

### The Belinda Experience
- What happened
- Why I liked talking to her (she was very honest and felt a lot of emotions)

## Tuesday June 21st - The Second Day of the Program and our first site visit
- woke up a little later (run wasn't as empty)
- Lecture was great again, (felt more inclined to participate now that I've read the readings)
- lunch with people and sit in a park
- headed to site visit (started with powerpoint and just killed me to death, had coffee -> felt so much better -> started asking people what they'd barter and ended up making a list)
- The barter list was really fun, it helped me remember people's names and get to know someone a little bit better. It was also interesting that people often started out with (oh I have no skills) but then pulled out some really good offerings like dog training or childcare or personal training. Both a good way to know people and keep on tabs for my personal record if I ever need some good scones.
- got back and went to starbucks to download readings and text people to meet up
- now about to head to dinner
