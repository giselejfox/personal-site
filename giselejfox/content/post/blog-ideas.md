# Post Ideas

## Academic or Amsterdam based (not super me focused but my own input)

### Barriers to Co-creation in college
- start off by saying what is co creation
- why it's hard to cocreate in college projects
- why that feels off

### A reflection on the role of museums and their ability to change and adapt to modern day visitors in the modern day

### Relocation of the royal library and what that'll look like



## Kind of me focused and my relation to the material/amsterdam

### Ode to working in a physical space
seems more fulfilling than digital, you're working with actual environments
me just complaining about informatics

### My experiences with the 10 faces of innovation 

### It's okay to be outside in Amsterdam



## Misc

### Why I like these types of lectures
- discussion based
- short in the day
- feels like a genuine conversation and everybody's interested

### Gisele's efforts in community building
- explanation that I was scared to go on the trip
- explaining how I usually interact (questions)
- giving some examples of what I did
    - passing the note around the table - face sketch
    - asking people about the barter list
    - xtra good questions to ask
- what I've seen other people do that I like
    - if I'm spaced out just wave at me
    - ask me how I'm holding up
    - include everybody in everything (sandy's discord is a savng grace)
    - ask a good funny question
        - if you would be a furniture what would you be? - it's nice to see how someone imagines themselves as being maybe useful or somewhere comfortable for someone to return to... very interesting

### The Belinda Experience
- What happened
- Why I liked talking to her (she was very honest and felt a lot of emotions)

## Tuesday June 21st - The Second Day of the Program and our first site visit
- woke up a little later (run wasn't as empty)
- Lecture was great again, (felt more inclined to participate now that I've read the readings)
- lunch with people and sit in a park
- headed to site visit (started with powerpoint and just killed me to death, had coffee -> felt so much better -> started asking people what they'd barter and ended up making a list)
- The barter list was really fun, it helped me remember people's names and get to know someone a little bit better. It was also interesting that people often started out with (oh I have no skills) but then pulled out some really good offerings like dog training or childcare or personal training. Both a good way to know people and keep on tabs for my personal record if I ever need some good scones.
- got back and went to starbucks to download readings and text people to meet up
- now about to head to dinner
