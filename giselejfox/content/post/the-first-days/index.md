It's been a little over 2 jam packed days since I touched down in Amsterdam so finally taking some time to unwind and reflect in a post seems like the perfect treat. As I'm writing this I'm sitting in Sarphatipark [Figure 1], leaning on one of the trees by the pond, swatting off gnats, and hoping one of the friendly dogs comes up to me. Sitting in this public space is comfortable and welcoming, almost as comfortable as being in my own living room and that's saying something as someone who has a real deep tie to their home base back in Seattle. So for now I'll type away and let my noise cancelling headphones dampen the little bit of street noise Amsterdam produces despite all the bicycles.

There's been a lot to learn over the past 3 days so here's a quick yet detailed breakdown of what's happened and any neat little thoughts or discoveries.

## Breakdown of the days so far:

### Sunday June 19th - The First Day in Amsterdam 
The first day in Amsterdam was a rough one. I took the overnight flight straight from Seattle to Amsterdam which left Seattle Saturday the 18th and arrived to Amsterdam 
- I gave a guy my number on the plave that's why I stayed up but i also got an hour
- We touched down ane rode in with Teal and Riley (I liked traveling with people because we can be clueless together)
- We dropped off our bags and killed time
    - went for a walk to kill time
    - We went for lunch
    - got vertigo while thrifting
    - chilled in the dining space
    - as soon as Riley's room was ready she graciously let me nap with her
    - awoke at 5:30 for our orientation which brought us around
    - went to dinner with some people!

Overall an incredibly exciting time with some quality time (and jet lag bonding) right off the bat.

### Monday June 20th - The First Day of the Program
- PICTURE Started off with a run (dead city at 6:00am, still light as day)
- lecture (awesome way to hold lecture) (also cool to see AFAB people be loud)
- PICTURE lecture drawings
- biked around (anxiety from bike and ordering -> drawing calmed significantly -> knew to now avoid busy area)
- Talked to the server a bit (drawing's a good conversation starter)
- made it back and went to dinner
- PICTURE passed around a piece of paper with the "draw the person in front of you"
- At the end of the day I realized that I didn't want to open tiktok, though I would have if given the chance, and I actually just wanted to do the readings (i think this will be a great social media scrolling break for me, my head feels so much clearer)

Great day to get some alone time, though not as validating as expected. It was nice to be a goof alone though and not have to worry about anyone making mistakes 

### Tuesday June 21st - The Second Day of the Program and our first site visit
- woke up a little later (run wasn't as empty)
- Lecture was great again, (felt more inclined to participate now that I've read the readings)
- lunch with people and sit in a park
- headed to site visit (started with powerpoint and just killed me to death, had coffee -> felt so much better -> started asking people what they'd barter and ended up making a list)
- The barter list was really fun, it helped me remember people's names and get to know someone a little bit better. It was also interesting that people often started out with (oh I have no skills) but then pulled out some really good offerings like dog training or childcare or personal training. Both a good way to know people and keep on tabs for my personal record if I ever need some good scones.
- got back and went to starbucks to download readings and text people to meet up
- now about to head to dinner
