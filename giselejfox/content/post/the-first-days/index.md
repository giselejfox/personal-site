It's been a little over 2 jam packed days since I touched down in Amsterdam so finally taking some time to unwind and reflect in a post seems like the perfect treat. As I'm writing this I'm sitting in Sarphatipark [Figure 1], leaning on one of the trees by the pond, swatting off gnats, and hoping one of the friendly dogs comes up to me. Sitting in this public space is comfortable and welcoming, almost as comfortable as being in my own living room and that's saying something as someone who has a real deep tie to their home base back in Seattle. So for now I'll type away and let my noise cancelling headphones dampen the little bit of street noise Amsterdam produces despite all the bicycles.

## Days so far:

### Sunday June 19th - The First Day in Amsterdam 
The first day in Amsterdam was a rough one. I took the overnight flight straight from Seattle which left Saturday the 18th at 1ish and arrived to Amsterdam the next day at 8am. That means that I should have slept the whole way to set my body on the right path but there was little to no sleep on the flight. However, some excitement did result from what would be an otherwise cramped and tiring experince. I (drumroll please) ended up giving my number to the guy I sat next to on the flight! We started by doing a cross word together before the plane took off (thanks to a well-thought out prompt from me) and chatting the whole last two hours. I was planning on hanging out with him during his layover but at that point jetlag started to get me so I quickly handed him my number and then jetted off to passport control where he wouldn't be able to follow me. In any case, shoutout to the wonderful conversationalist Michael from Issaquah! 

To set the scene post excitment: I'm standing at baggage claim with Riley and Teal (two other gals from the program) and even though it's 11pm Seattle time, it's 8am Amsterdam time and that means I have more than 12 hours to go before I'm supposed to be sleeping. This, no surprise to anyone, turned out to be a bad time. We made it to the hotel in record time but had to find a way to kill time before our rooms were ready so me and some other students headed out on a walk based on vibes. That meaning we just walked until a cross streets and turned onto the one that seemed the most interesting. We continued that walk with a pizza stop in the middle and ended in a thrift store where I jokingly asked Bellamy "Is it just me or is the floor moving" and turns out it was, in fact, me getting vertigo due to being awake for more than 24 hours. 

After that we headed back to the hotel to just sit down and Riley was kind enough to let me nap in her (twin) bed with her until orientation st

Overall an incredibly exciting time with some quality time (and jet lag bonding) right off the bat.

### Monday June 20th - The First Day of the Program
- PICTURE Started off with a run (dead city at 6:00am, still light as day)
- lecture (awesome way to hold lecture) (also cool to see AFAB people be loud)
- PICTURE lecture drawings
- biked around (anxiety from bike and ordering -> drawing calmed significantly -> knew to now avoid busy area)
- Talked to the server a bit (drawing's a good conversation starter)
- made it back and went to dinner
- PICTURE passed around a piece of paper with the "draw the person in front of you"
- At the end of the day I realized that I didn't want to open tiktok, though I would have if given the chance, and I actually just wanted to do the readings (i think this will be a great social media scrolling break for me, my head feels so much clearer)

Great day to get some alone time, though not as validating as expected. It was nice to be a goof alone though and not have to worry about anyone making mistakes 

### Tuesday June 21st - The Second Day of the Program and our first site visit
- woke up a little later (run wasn't as empty)
- Lecture was great again, (felt more inclined to participate now that I've read the readings)
- lunch with people and sit in a park
- headed to site visit (started with powerpoint and just killed me to death, had coffee -> felt so much better -> started asking people what they'd barter and ended up making a list)
- The barter list was really fun, it helped me remember people's names and get to know someone a little bit better. It was also interesting that people often started out with (oh I have no skills) but then pulled out some really good offerings like dog training or childcare or personal training. Both a good way to know people and keep on tabs for my personal record if I ever need some good scones.
- got back and went to starbucks to download readings and text people to meet up
- now about to head to dinner
