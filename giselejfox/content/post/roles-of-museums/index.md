// Dramatic exposition of the first lecture day
The first discussions we had in our breakfast room lectures was around the following: what is an archive, what's a museum, and what's a library?

// explanation of the program and why this question is relevenat
Since we're on the pro

// What me and my group talke about in terms of museums

// lead into it helped shape the way we looked at site vitis during the first week

// Mauritshuis actively tried to link the colonial portraits and paintings to the present by their photography exhibits there. They were frank in their descriptions of paintings and gave context in modern day language

// Explanation of the Anne Frank house
- big revamp in the last two years
- changed from a christian narrative to a jewish one
- it also took into context that people might not have the same knowledge background.

// So if museums are inherently educational and are curated and designed experiences, they share a burden of contextualizing the art they house for the modern day. Art can be used for fun, as seen in the Van Gogh exhibit, but when it comes to culture heritage you have to be innovative to accomodate the currrent situation, especially the amount of information people might have coming into it. The anne frank museum had surprisingly little context, the rooms were bare and there was hardly any information on the walls.

// What I like about museums is when they link to the modern day and show how the things they are showing impacted us now
