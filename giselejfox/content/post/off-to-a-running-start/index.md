I got up the first day of the program at 5:30 and decided to call it a start. I ended up going for a run and because Amsterdam is so north it was broad daylight at 6:00am and completely empty, I got the city to myself! It was such a beautiful treat to be able to zip past all the amazing architecture and the hug the canals while downloading the google maps of the area to my noggin.

After breakfast we had lecture, all in the brekafast room of the small hotel that holds only us 23 students for the entirety of our program. It was fully discussion based, no powerpoint in sight and even though that held my attention and I felt more engaged than regular lecture I still found myself skecthing to keep the wiggles out.

After lecture I felt a little antsy so I rented a bike from dear Gerrit, the staff member who's worked at the hotel the longest, and set out for a ride! I just decided to find a place to eat on my way and it was a good idea in theory but turned out to be a little anxiety inducing. I was already antsy from the lecture and then I accidentally biked towards the city center and got caught up in a whole system of bike traffic I wasn't accustomed to. I finally made it to an outdoor cafe near Vondelpark and sat down with little to know knowledge of dutch restaurant etiquette. I stewed in uncertainty but learned pretty quickly that you have to flag someone down if you want to get service. The one thing that grounded me and pulled me out of my slump was starting to sketch my surroundings and take time to notice everything around me. The lunch was delicious and the waiter was incredibly nice to me about my drawing too!

I made it back in time to head to an opening dinner for everyone in the program. We ventured to the north of Amsterdam Centrum and elbowed our way onto the ferry to take us accross the water. The table reserved for us was long at the back of the restaurant and backed with a wall of plants that we all fawned over. Before the food got sent out I pulled out my notebook and was about to start up one of my favorite past times, drawing someone while they draw me at the same time, when I came up with something better. I wrote "draw the person in front of you" at the top of the page, drew a quick doodle of the person in front of me and then passed the pen and paper down the line. By the end of the night we had two tables worth of drawings and seemingly a hit on our hands as everyone kept on saying they couldn't draw and then putting down the cutest drawing known to man. It turned out to be a great way to bring people together and give people something to do during a long introductory dinner.

The best feeling was that at the end of the day, when I was back in the hotel room absolutely exhausted from a full day out, all I wanted to do was the readings for the next day. All I wanted to do was relax and read about innovation in public policy because I couldn't wait to start the day over again and be able to contribute to the discussion in lecture yet again.
